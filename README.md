# TASK - 2 NUMBER GUSSING GAME
This project is done by using the concepts of loops, if-else conditions, and a random number generator. Here, a random number will be generated between 1 and 100, and you have to guess the number that is being generated. You will have a limited number of attempts based on the difficulty level. Although it's a very easy project, I added some fun by incorporating different difficulty levels.

# TASK - 3 ATM INTERFACE
In this project, I utilized the concepts of class-object, ArrayList, methods, switch case, and loops. Here, the user's user ID and password are predefined in the system. The first user needs to enter the user ID and password. If our system recognizes the user as legitimate, it will grant access to perform banking-related tasks such as withdrawal, deposit, transfer, and mini statement.
